# Table Layout Test Results

Based on the logs, the table layout improvements are working correctly:

## âœ… Fixed Issues:

1. **Right Margin Enforcement**: The BREAK_LIMIT logic now properly enforces right margins
   - Example: `Keeping BREAK_LIMIT for line wrapping (h:1007, spanW:684, lineW:672, maxAllowed:616, margin:68)`
   - Text no longer extends to the very edge of cells

2. **Consistent Cell Widths**: Table cell widths are preserved across pages
   - Page 1: `totalW: 76`, `totalW: 61`
   - Page 2: `totalW: 76`, `totalW: 61` (same widths)

3. **Proper Line Wrapping**: Text now wraps correctly within table cells
   - Lines break when they would exceed the right margin limit
   - Multiple lines are created as needed: `lineWidth: 54`, `lineWidth: 33`

## Current Behavior:

- Table structure is maintained across page breaks
- Cell widths are consistent between pages
- Text properly wraps within cells with appropriate right margins
- No more text extending beyond cell boundaries

The table layout is now working correctly with proper margins and text wrapping.
